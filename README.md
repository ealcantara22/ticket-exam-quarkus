# Ticket Exam (Quarkus)

##### Prologue
As a developer, java was de second programming language that I worked with "professionally" 
back in 2014 - 2015, and I haven't work with it since then. The main idea behind this project 
is to refresh what I think I know about java by actually building something.

Why exam?
This project comes from a real developers candidate evaluation project (don't kill me @bvisonl). 
In my opinion this is a great project, contains a moderate level of complexity and offers room
to introduce the concepts that I wanna try. (See [NTIDev/ticket-exam](https://github.com/ntidev/ticket-exam))
